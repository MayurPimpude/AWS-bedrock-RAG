## Introduction
The AWS Bedrock RAG project leverages AWS Bedrock's suite of AI services to create a powerful retrieval-augmented generation application. This application enhances content generation by integrating retrieval mechanisms, ensuring more accurate and relevant outputs.

## Features
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation using AWS Bedrock.
- Integration with Amazon's SDLX and Titan models.
- Example code and notebooks for easy replication and experimentation.

## Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MayurPimpude/AWS-bedrock-RAG.git
    cd AWS-bedrock-RAG
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure AWS**
    Make sure your AWS credentials are configured correctly. You can use the AWS CLI to set up your credentials:
    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

## Usage
Run the provided scripts and notebooks to start experimenting with RAG using AWS Bedrock. The notebooks include detailed instructions on how to use the various models and services.

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open and Run the Notebooks**
    Open the notebooks in your browser and follow the instructions to explore RAG applications.

## Models Explored
### SDLX
SDLX is a high-performance model from Amazon designed for scalable and efficient language tasks. It excels in tasks requiring deep understanding and contextual generation.

### Titan
Titan is Amazon's robust model tailored for large-scale language processing tasks. It is optimized for both speed and accuracy, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Output

AWS RAG - using Jurassic-2 Ultra
